As one of the most widely used techniques in operations research, {\em
  mathematical programming} is defined as a means of maximizing a quantity known
as {\em objective function}, subject to a set of constraints represented by
equations and inequalities. Some known subtopics of mathematical programming are
linear programming, nonlinear programming, multiobjective programming, goal
programming, dynamic programming, and multilevel programming$^{[1]}$.

It is impossible to cover in a single chapter every concept of mathematical
programming. This chapter introduces only the basic concepts and techniques of
mathematical programming such that readers gain an understanding of them
throughout the book$^{[2,3]}$.
